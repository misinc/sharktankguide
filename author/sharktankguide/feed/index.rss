<p>I love this product! I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve dropped my phone or a box of mints or even my car keys in between the seat and the console! The Drop Stop fits perfectly in that space and prevents items from falling through the cracks. The less distracted you are, the safer you are.</p>



<ul><li>WE ARE THE ONLY SOLUTION WITH 100% GAP COVERAGE &#8211; IN FRONT OF, SURROUNDING, AND BEHIND SEAT BELT CATCH. Drop Stop attaches to the seat belt catch via built in slot; moves with the seat and no need to readjust or reinstall.</li><li>AS SEEN ON TV/SHARK TANK, Drop Stop blocks that annoying yet ever so dangerous gap between your car or truck seat and center console</li><li>BEWARE OF CHEAP KNOCKOFFS AND COUNTERFEITERS!!! IF IT DOESN&#8217;T SAY DROP STOP ON IT, THEN DON&#8217;T BUY IT! Drop Stop is the Original and Patented Car Seat Gap Filler. Every other product that claims to fill the gap works poorly, or not at all. Drop Stop will never fall apart and lasts a lifetime!</li><li>Each package comes with 2 Drop Stops (1 for the driver side and 1 for the passenger side; universal fit), a Slide Free Pad and an LED Credit Card Light</li><li>One size fits most vehicles! High Grade Neoprene casing allows Drop Stop to contract or expand to whatever size gap you have. One color blends all! The Gap is always a dark shadow so once you install Drop Stop, you won&#8217;t know it&#8217;s there until it Stops the Drop!</li></ul>

<p>I have to admit, I got a little emotional during the pitch for Cup Board Pro. Here were three young people promoting a product made by their father. His dream was to pitch his creation on Shark Tank, but passed away just a few months before.</p>



<p>Keith Young was a NYC fireman and was one of the first responders during 9/11. Unbeknownst to him, he had developed&nbsp;synovial soft sarcoma, a rare form of cancer caused by his exposure at ground zero. He always loved cooking and had even appeared as a contestant on Chopped and won both times! His love of cooking gave him the idea to create his unique cutting board. “The Cup Board Pro” is made of bamboo and has a cup that attaches to catch all the drippings. The board is angled so the juices from along the groove right into the cup! It’s an ingenious invention.</p>



<p>But the story is even more heartbreaking. Keith invented his product in 2010, but he had to put his idea away and help his wife after she was diagnosed with Breast Cancer. She died in 2012.</p>



<p>So his three brave children went on Shark Tank and even showed their father’s audition tape. All the Sharks were moved and they did something I have ever see before. They asked Keith’s children to leave the tank while they discussed a deal. They decided to all work together and offer $100,000 for a 20% stake in the business and promised to donate all their profits to a charity that helps firefighters affected by 9/11.</p>



<p>You too can <a href="https://amzn.to/2QyOSwh">support Keith Young and the NYFD by purchasing the “Cup Board Pro” from Amazon</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I fell for this company as soon as I heard their pitch on Shark Tank. How could you not love a business that sells an empty box for $8?</p>
<p>One of the founders worked at The Onion, the other is an experienced Graphic Designer. Together they have created a company that sells prank gift boxes. You buy a box for a prank gift and then include your real gift inside. What a brilliant idea!</p>
<p>They were featured on Season 10, Episode 7 and received multiple offers but ultimately accepted a deal from Barbara. I can’t wait to see how their company does.</p>
