I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve dropped my phone or a box of mints or even my car keys in between the seat and the console! The Drop Stop fits perfectly in that space and prevents items from falling through the cracks. The less distracted you are, the safer you are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>WE ARE THE ONLY SOLUTION WITH 100% GAP COVERAGE &#8211; IN FRONT OF, SURROUNDING, AND BEHIND SEAT BELT CATCH. Drop Stop attaches to the seat belt catch via built in slot; moves with the seat and no need to readjust or reinstall.<\/li><li>AS SEEN ON TV\/SHARK TANK, Drop Stop blocks that annoying yet ever so dangerous gap between your car or truck seat and center console<\/li><li>BEWARE OF CHEAP KNOCKOFFS AND COUNTERFEITERS!!! IF IT DOESN&#8217;T SAY DROP STOP ON IT, THEN DON&#8217;T BUY IT! Drop Stop is the Original and Patented Car Seat Gap Filler. Every other product that claims to fill the gap works poorly, or not at all. Drop Stop will never fall apart and lasts a lifetime!<\/li><li>Each package comes with 2 Drop Stops (1 for the driver side and 1 for the passenger side; universal fit), a Slide Free Pad and an LED Credit Card Light<\/li><li>One size fits most vehicles! High Grade Neoprene casing allows Drop Stop to contract or expand to whatever size gap you have. One color blends all! The Gap is always a dark shadow so once you install Drop Stop, you won&#8217;t know it&#8217;s there until it Stops the Drop!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B00BYH6C1E\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;ascsub&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=sharktankdotguide-20&amp;linkId=b95c00b8bd1eabc86cd5b1045ab58c47&amp;language=en_US\">Buy Now on Amazon for <img src=\"https:\/\/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com\/e\/ir?t=SharkTankDotGuide-20&l=alb&o=1&a=B00BYH6C1E\" width=\"1px\" height=\"1px\" alt=\"\" style=\"position: fixed !important; bottom: -1px !important; right: -1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" \/>\r\n<\/a><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"http:\/\/classic.avantlink.com\/affiliate_app_confirm.php?mode=js&amp;authResponse=9a160cc39edefc142ccd980e34981f03ecbdf363\"><\/script><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":115,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","spay_email":""},"categories":[10,11],"tags":[23],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/shark-tank-guide.mystagingwebsite.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/81XGUIzspRL._SL1500_.jpg?fit=1500%2C1500&ssl=1","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pdcJvv-1L","jetpack-related-posts":[{"id":63,"url":"https:\/\/shark-tank-guide.mystagingwebsite.com\/2018\/12\/cup-board-pro\/","url_meta":{"origin":109,"position":0},"title":"Cup Board Pro","date":"December 4, 2018","format":false,"excerpt":"I have to admit, I got a little emotional during the pitch for Cup Board Pro.
